.. _OpenMDAO Tutorials: tutorials/index.html

These tutorials serve to give an initial introduction to the OpenMDAO framework.
They are intended to be done in sequence. Once completed,
you will be able to construct models by linking multiple analyses together and then perform optimization on those models.
