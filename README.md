# blue
This is the PRE-ALPHA version of OpenMDAO 2.0
(we have codenamed it 'blue').

Important Note:
---------------

While the API is MOSTLY stable, we reserve the right to change things as needed.
Production runs should still be done in 1.7.x for now.

We will be making very frequent updates to this code. If youâ€™re going to try it,
make sure you pull these updates often

* Pass-by-object variables
* DOE (Design of Experiment) driver and all other case drivers
* Parallel Finite Difference
* File-wrapping utilities
* File variables
* Total Derivatives checking
* Group Finite Difference
* Complex Step approximation for Component/Group derivatives
* Parallel Adjoint and Parallel Forward derivative calculation performance speedup
* Constraint Sparsity specification for Pyoptsparse
* Active-set constraint calculation disabling
* Brent Solver
* Analysis Error handling
